# Beric's Page

Hello Everyone!
My name is Beric, as my handle would suggest. However, I am not the "first" Beric, so the name is about 50% correct.

- I am a student at a school
- I have gone to tournaments for robotics before
- I am intrested in engineering
- I enjoy videogames
- I am being intentionally vague as this will be public

Feel free to browse through my **Public** repositories, and take whatever code the license suggests you can take.
